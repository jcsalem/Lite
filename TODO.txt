** Bugs **
?? --rate broken/confusing on Lsparkle (Lstarry doc is wrong)
rate for bounce appears to be in terms of frames not time
images don't work

** planerun **
bounce rate seemed too fast
Lstarry and Lfirefly were too slow
Lfirefly might be better if single pixels, denser and faster
Durations overall should be longer

** New **
Allow Ltool stuff to be aggregated (e.g., bounce a black pixel on rainbow)
More than one pixel on bounce/rotate for Ltool

--FadeIn and --FadeOut std args
Options to Sparkle filter
Lchase (like rotate but any number of items)
Clean up Sparkle filter timing (either time-based anti-aliasing or sync)
Extend Ltool for rotwashbounce
Lpv - persistence of vision display.  

** Image Reading Notes **
For image reading and resize: consider Cimg, Imagemagick
  Cimg: insert #define cimg_display_type 0 before #include "Cimg.h"
  Imagemagick: Better since standalone package   http://blog.sunekaae.com/2013/04/imagemagick-resize-speed-on-raspberry-pi.html

** Running multiple groups in parallel **
Allow each group to have it's own output buffer
Run() can run multiple groups
New Lbuffer that gathers updates from multiple sources and forwards to an output buffer
