*** Wifi Setup for Raspberry Pi ***

** Recommend Adapter **
This was all tested with the Edimax EW-7811Un dongle which is recommended and uses the
Realtek RTL8188CUS chip.  They will probably work with any RTL8188 related chip.

** Driver **
With recent versions of Raspian (late 2013 onwards), no separate driver install is needed.
However, these drivers don't support the nl80211 API which is needed for recent versions
of hostapd to work. See notes on host access point configuration.

** Power Management **  
IMPORTANT: Disable power management so it doesn't shutdown after non-use.

Basically: Create /etc/modprobe.d/8192cu.conf with the line:
  options 8192cu rtw_power_mgnt=0 rtw_enusbss=0

** Client Setup **
Options:
A) Single access point (either open or WEP)
Replace all the stuff after allow-hotplug wlan0 in /etc/network/interfaces with
  allow-hotplug wlan0
  auto wlan0
  iface wlan0 inet dhcp
  wireless-essid WIFI-SSID
  wireless-key 01234567890ABCDEF0123456789
The last line is only needed for WEP. Remove it if it's an open connection.

B) Single access point WPA or WPA2
Replace all the stuff after allow hotplug wlan0 in /etc/network/interfaces with
  allow-hotplug wlan0
  auto wlan0
  iface wlan0 inet dhcp
  wpa-ssid "WIFI-SSID"
  wpa-psk "WPA2PSK-PASSWORD"

C) Multiple access points
Use wpa_supplicant
