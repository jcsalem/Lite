*** Lite: Rendering Pipeline ***

Lite implements an object based approach to rendering.
During each rendering loop, all the Lobjs are updated and then rendered into an LBuffer.

** Data Types **
Lobj is the basic object class. It has a speed, position, and color. Lobjs are rendered onto 
an Lbuffer. 
An Lbuffer is the basic output class. It has a number of lights organized in a 1D strip.
There are three types of Lbuffers: 
 1) Output device Lbuffers (e.g., LBufferPhys, CKbuffer and StripBuffer). 
    Represents an actual output device.
 2) Filter buffers: These cascade on top of any Output buffer and modify the reading and 
    writing to that device.
 3) ComboBuffer: These combine other buffers, end-to-end.

An Lproc is a procedure that is applied to every Lobj during rendering.

An Lgroup is a collection of objects.
A group proc is a procedure that is called once per group just after rendering a frame.

** Rendering Loop **

Loop forever:
  Clear output buffer
  For each Lobj in Lgroup:
     Update position
     Update Color 
     Run all Lprocs
     Render the Lobj into the output buffer
  Display using output buffer
  Run Group Function  


** Filters **
Filters are implemented using Lbuffers. The operate on the 1D image buffer level. 
Filters are most often used to remap the coordinates.

** LProcs **
LProcs apply at the object level and can change the color or location of an object.
