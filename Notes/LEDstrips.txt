Here are the types of LED strip drivers that I know about.
The one that has best quality and can be controlled via a Raspberry Pi is the WS2801.  
The WS2812 strips are denser but have very tight timings that require an Arduino.

WS2801 
24-bit color. Serial rate up to 25mHz. Clock+data style. PWM is 2.5kHz
Although the serial rate is fast, there must be a 500microsecond delay to latch the data.

WS2812 (similar is WS2811 w/o LEDs)
All-in-one LED plus PWM driver. 
24-bit color. Serial rate up to 800kHz (400kHz or 200kHz for WS2811).  Uses single data line. PWM is 400Hz (??)
Adafruit says: 32 pixel update rate 400Hz
Tight timing requirement: less than 1 microsecond!

Strips come in 30, 60, or 144 LEDs per meter!  Here's one: http://www.adafruit.com/products/1460

LPD8806 (similar LDP8803 and LPD8809)
21-bit color. Serial rate up to 20mHz. Uses SPI protocol (two control pins: clock and data). 1.2mHz PWM.
Adafruit says: 32 pixel update rate 4kHz
First LED is loaded first, then second and so on.  This is opposite typical shift register mode.
Timing seems pretty flexible.
Limit: LEDs are latched one at a time. No way to latch all at once.

HL1606
Old. 15-bit color. Update rate too slow. Serial rate is only 200Hz. 500Hz PWM
SPI protocol but seems a little funky.
